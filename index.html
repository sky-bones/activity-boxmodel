        <p>
        A young scientist created Terrarium bots last month in hopes of finding a way to recreate the atmosphere, and to bring hope to the bunker where the lab was based.

        They never imagined that those tiny robots would become the savior for the thousands left on the planet.

        <img src="images/teranium-bot.jpg" alt="Terrarium Bot, a small round egg-shaped glass globe with small robot legs projecting from it. Inside the globe moss and small plants are growing. Attached to the bottom are four mechancial legs to move it around.">

        <p>
        The scientist declared that the bots were determined to find sunlight, and explored the compound until they found it. When they did, it was almost something out of a movie.

        </figure>
        
        <p>
        When the young scientist looked through the hole that had shed sunlight inside the bunker, he saw the Earth, as lush and clean, as it had been thousands of years ago, before the disruption of the Earth's magnetic field.

        <p>
        With this discovery of the Earth's surface in repair, there is now hope to do the following:  
        </p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Construct buildings above ground</li>
        <li>Introduce knowledge of the earth's biology back into school curriculum</li>
        <li>Create sustainable structures and ways of life that will be stable for the coming   generations</li>
        </ol>
          
    <p>With these hopes and dreams, the young scientist hopes to bring the world back to the way it should be, and become the world that they have imagined.</p>
